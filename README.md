### Project Overview

This project leverages Power BI to analyze the electric vehicle (EV) market, focusing on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). The analysis aims to provide insights into market size, technological advancements, and market share distribution between BEVs and PHEVs.

### Data Source

The dataset includes comprehensive information on electric vehicles, covering both BEVs and PHEVs. This data can be sourced from government databases, industry reports, or open datasets provided by automotive research organizations.[download here]

### Tools

- Excel
- Power BI

### Data cleaning

In Inital Data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Data cleaning and formatting

### Explorating Data Analysis

EDA involves exploring the electric vechicle data to answer the key questions, such as
-  Calculate the total number of electric vehicles registered each year from 2010 onwards.
-  display the number of electric vehicles registered in each state.
-  Calculate and visualize the total number of electric vehicles by manufacturer to determine the top 10 manufacturers dominating the market.
-  Calculate the proportion of electric vehicles eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives.
-  Calculate and visualize the total number of electric vehicles by model to identify the top 10 most popular models.

### Analysis

The analysis in Power BI involves:
- Data Cleaning: Using Power BI's data transformation tools to clean and prepare the dataset.
- Total Vehicles: Calculating the total number of BEVs and PHEVs to understand market size.
- Average Electric Range: Computing the average electric range for all vehicles in the dataset.
- BEV Analysis: Identifying the total number of BEVs and calculating their percentage of the total EV market.
- PHEV Analysis: Identifying the total number of PHEVs and calculating their percentage of the total EV market.

### Results

The Power BI report will include visualizations and detailed insights such as:
Total number of electric vehicles.
Average electric range of the vehicles.
Total number and percentage of BEVs.
Total number and percentage of PHEVs.

### Recommendations
 
Based on the analysis, the project will provide recommendations for stakeholders on market trends, technological advancements, and strategic planning to enhance the adoption and efficiency of electric vehicles.
